# Ray's Design Library


All the files the library follows a specific naming convention consisting of 5 descriptors separated by a single underscore.

|# |Descriptor   | Example   |
|---|---|---|
|1| Start with your initials  | RS  |
|2| The main project that the design is relevant for  | GaAs, RC, MISC,...  |
|3| The name of the design   | EtchTest, Mesa, Hallbar, ...  |
|4| The design dimension, in mm  | 6x7, 6x6, W4in, NA...  |
|5| The date, in MMDDYY  | October 15, 2021 represented as 101521  |

Every project in the library is given a 2 to 4 alphabet code. 
| Project  | Code  |
|---|---|
| Ohmic contacts to 2DES in GaAs heterostructures | [2DEG](#2deg) |
| Distributed broadband filter on Si | [RC](#rc) |
| Other Designs (utilities, test patterns) | [MISC](#misc) |
